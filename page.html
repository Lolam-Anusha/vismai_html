        <p>The best thing about this Pakodi is that it doesn't absorb oil like the Pakodi's we make with Bengal Gram flour.</p>
        <p>The Pakodi's we make with Bengal gram flour may not suit every one, but the Ragi ones are healthy as well as taste different and will be sure shot liked by all. Onions and Bengal Gram Flour Pakodi's are commonly made by all. This is also similar recipe-wise to that one. Follow the tips to get a crispy perfect taste.</p>
        <p>Please follow the tips before proceeding.</p>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <h3>Onions:</h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>The water that oozes out from the Onions is enough to mix the flour and other ingredients, but sprinkle some water if it is required.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Procedure to fry Pakodi's:</h3>
        <div>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Always fry the Pakodi's on a medium flame. Fry till the bubbles in the Oil reduce, as you may not be able to see whether it is fried, because of the colour of the Finger Millet Flour. Do not over fry them, as they become hard and burnt if you fry for a long time.</li>
                <li>To check if it is fried or not, remove a Pakodi from the Oil and press it with your finger.</li>
            </ol>
